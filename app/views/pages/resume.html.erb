          Applied Materials - (1994 - 2004)
          Utilized MS Access to create a variety of rapidly developed and deployed database applications to support the materials and logistics organizations of the Physical Vapor Deposition division. Made extensive use of Visual Basic for Applications to provide functionality and features not available in a typical “out of the box” install of Access. 


          Highlights:
          * Production Status database application. Tracked the status of all systems in production on the manufacturing floor, to include key milestones and part shortages. Replaced a variety individual spreadsheets each project manager maintained, with a central repository for all production status information and common reporting structure.
          * Virtual warehouse. Allowed for accurate storage, retrieval and tracking of manufacturing parts that were held in temporary storage locations that were not able to utilize the corporate ERP system due to constraints of that system. Utilized barcodes and scanners to increase accuracy and speed of data entry. This application greatly reduced misplacement of manufacturing parts located in temporary storage locations, as well as increased their retrieval time and delivery. Also provided visibility of these parts to other members of the organization.
          * Obsolete and excess inventory. Provided for the reconciliation and disposition of obsolete and excess inventory against the corporate ERP system. Eliminated a very manual and paper-based process with one that automated many of the steps of the process, and greatly reduced data entry errors, as well as increasing the overall speed of the process.
